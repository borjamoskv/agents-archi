## 2. The SOAT Mechanism (SAGA 7-Step Write-Path)

The **Sovereign Operational Audit Trail (SOAT)** enforces write-path integrity across the agent lifecycle. Any state mutation must complete the SAGA pipeline:

    A[Agent Action Proposal] --> Step1[1. Validation Guard]
    Step1 --> Step2[2. Taint Cryptographic Signature]
    Step2 --> Step3[3. Schema Validation]
    Step3 --> Step4[4. Encryption Layer]
    Step4 --> Step5[5. Immutable Ledger Entry]
    Step5 --> Step6[6. SQLite Persistence with Rollback]
    Step6 --> Step7[7. Vector/KV Indexing]
    Step7 --> StateChange[State Mutated Successfully]
```

### Protocol Specifications
1. **Validation Guard:** Sanitizes input commands and validates boundary states before execution.
2. **Cryptographic Taint Signature:** Appends the CORTEX-TAINT token using `SHA3-256(payload + AgentID)`.
3. **Schema Validation:** Enforces strict interface conformance, blocking stochastic outputs from modifying memory.
4. **Encryption Layer:** Encrypts sensitive secrets at rest using standard OS keyring primitives.
5. **Immutable Ledger Entry:** Hashes the action into the current Merkle tree, updating the epoch block.
6. **SQLite Persistence:** Writes atomically to SQLite with fallback rollback snapshotting.
7. **Vector/KV Indexing:** Updates local context indexes. All side effects are designed as idempotent functions.

## 3. SOTA Gap Analysis (Threat Taxonomy)

An evaluation of the 10 critical threat vectors defined in the taxonomy of `agents.archi`:

| # | Threat Vector | Status | Mechanism / Mitigations |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | Prompt Injection | **Partial** | ASL Sandbox filters forbidden system commands. Stochastic jailbreaks require run-time validation. |
| **02** | Tool Misuse | **Unsolved** | Permissions are static; missing Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) and dynamic scopes. |
| **03** | Memory Poisoning | **Unsolved** | Conversational state is susceptible to indirect memory corruption during retrieval cycles. |
| **04** | Privilege Escalation | **Unsolved** | Lacks runtime capability segregation and multi-context sandboxing. |
| **05** | Economic Exploits | **Unsolved** | Vulnerable to oracle desynchronization (e.g., Exactly Protocol flashloans) without real-time arbitrage bounds. |
| **06** | MCP Supply Chain | **Unsolved** | Malicious tool injections are not verified at load time. Lacks tool signing. |
| **07** | Multi-Agent Collusion | **Unsolved** | Lacks Byzantine consensus on collaborative swarm plans. |
| **08** | Infinite Loop DoS | **Partial** | Monitored via execution counters. Lacks hardware-enforced CPU/Token budget kill switches. |
| **09** | Side-Channel Exfiltration | **Unsolved** | Timing and token consumption patterns are not masked. |
| **10** | Identity Hijacking | **Unsolved** | Lacks cryptographic proof of identity (e.g., Decentralized Identifiers) for individual subagents. |

## 4. SOTA-Loop Matriz Analítica

Analytical matrix evaluating alternative architectures for agent security registries:

| Autor / Proyecto | Año | Objetivos | Metodología | Resultados | Conclusiones |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CSA ATF** | 2026 | Define trust bounds for agents | Zero Trust + ABAC policies | Conceptual standards | Defer guidelines to developers without enforcement. |
| **VeriGuard** | 2025 | Intercept dangerous actions | Static verification of AST | Verified execution paths | Excellent for deterministic rules, fails on LLM semantic drift. |
| **OWASP Agentic** | 2025 | Standardize threat taxonomy | Empirical vulnerability analysis | Top 10 vulnerabilities | Provides framework, lacks code-level implementation. |
| **agents.archi** | 2026 | Cryptographically verify agent runs | Z3 SMT verification + Merkle SOAT | Interactive visual registry | Achieves C5-REAL audit trails, but most active mitigation features are simulated. |

## 5. Biopsia Crítica

- **Mecanismo Base:** ASL (Agent Specification Language) translates system boundaries into Z3 SMT assertions for mathematical path verification, combined with a 7-step SAGA pipeline that records audit trails onto a Merkle tree.
- **Fallo Estructural (Vacío Exérgico):** While the SOAT audit ledger is cryptographically sound, the runtime defense mechanisms for 8 out of 10 threat vectors (such as MCP Supply Chain exploits or Multi-Agent Collusion) remain **Unsolved** or **Simulated**. The system excels at *recording* audit evidence but lacks *active prevention* engines at the VM level.
